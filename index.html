    <h3> Remembrance of Steve Jobs</h3>
    It is with deep sadness that I listen to the news that Steve has died. Steve <br>
     was the dear friend I did not know personally. He was to me the first of that <br>
      group of unselfish techs. He was THE genius of the 20th century. Yes, there <br>
       is something different about Steve, and he will live on. Condolence to his <br>
        family. <br>
        <p>George</p> <br><br>

        <h3>Remembrance of Steve Jobs</h3>
        I did not know Steve personally. I have never had the chance. Yet I feel <br>
         touched and profoundly sad today... My deepest condolences and my most <br>
          sincere sympathy to his family. May he rest in peace <br>
          <p>Guido</p> <br><br>

          <h3>Our condolences</h3>
          The iphone enabled non-techies and even old uncles and aunties in <br>
           Singapore to search for information. It opened up a whole world for the not- <br>
            so-brave and made life so much more colorful. We thank steve jobs for it. I <br>
             am inspired by his commitment and creativity to such wonderful work. <br>
             <p>Jacqueline from Singapore</p> <br><br>

             <h3>REMEMBERING STEVE</h3>
             Thanks to Steve Jobs, I have been allowed to thrive as an indie filmmaker. I <br>
              wrote my first screenplay on a Mac nearly 20 years ago. My MacBook is <br>
               reliable and stable and allows me to run budget, editing, and scheduling <br>
                software effortlessly... and my new 27inch iMac allows me to enjoy the <br>
                 editing tools of Final Cut Pro, the sweet codec of Apple ProRes HQ, and it's <br>
                  great to use with other creative applications. So much technology is at my <br>
                   fingertips without breaking the bank. To put it simply, Steve liberated a <br>
                    new generation of creative people and allowed greater power to the <br>
                     masses. My dreams became a reality thanks to Steve Jobs and Team <br>
                      His influence on the planet and his positive effect on lives makes him <br>
                      truly one of the most important human beings of the century. Thank you, Steve. <br>
                      <p>Michael </p> <br><br>

                      <h3>You were the greatest</h3>
                      You were the best man God has ever made. You are like the God of <br>
                       technology. When the first iPod came out I was amazed. The iPad was the <br>
                        best product I ever used in my very hands. I wish another man could appear <br>
                         today just like you. RIP my friend. we are all crying. good-bye. :*( <br>
                         <p>Michael</p> <br><br>

                         <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
                         Mr. Jobs, your products and ideas shape the world. As a 14 year old, I was <br>
                          incredibly awed and excited at having my first Apple product. The sleekness <br>
                           of the design and functionality of my iPod filled me with joy, and I would <br>
                            have no qualms against boasting it to my friends. My childhood was defined <br>
                             by technology, and by Apple. You have played a major role in my life; <br>
                              directly or indirectly is irrelevant. For that, I thank you. <br>
                               May the Apple, a product of your genius, shine forever. <br>
                               <p>Angela</p> <br><br>

                               <h3>A Great Loss</h3>
                               Just wanna express my deepest condolences to the family and friends of <br>
                                Steve Jobs. I am a fan of his work for some years and always appreciated <br>
                                 his creations and capacity for innovation. All we, APPLE fans, lost a mentor. <br>
                                 <p>Pedro</p> <br><br>

                                 <h3>bye genius...</h3>
                                 bye steve... bye the real apple ceo... bye the innovator... bye the genius... <br>
                                  hope the best for you... <br>
                                  <p>Eri</p> <br><br>

                                  <h3>Thank you</h3>
                                  You passed too young. Sadly I lost my mother to the same ailment ! Our son <br>
                                   is on the autistic spectrum and you singlehandedly with your wonderful <br>
                                    minds at apple brought joy to us as parents when we saw our son interact <br>
                                     so actively with his iPad. Thank you sir for having been a part of our life! RIP <br>
                                     <p>Diane</p> <br><br>

                                     <h3>Remembering Steve</h3>
                                     Steve Jobs was an inspirational and legendary person. He will be greatly <br>
                                      missed. May he rest in peace. I would like to extend my sincere <br>
                                       condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone else who cared <br>
                                      for him. <br>
                                      <p>Phoebe</p> <br><br>

                                      <h3>RIP Steve</h3>
                                      I've always admired Steve Jobs. A visionary for sure. He and his team <br>
                                       consistently designed products in a way no one else could seem to match. <br>
                                        Farewell to the worthiest of adversaries, from an Android fanboy. Also, I <br>
                                         have a Mac Mini and am damn proud of it. <br>
                                         <p>Josh</p> <br><br>

                                         <h3>an inspiration</h3>
                                         Definitely a man that inspired me in many ways. I will miss his keynotes and <br>
                                          his visionary leadership that took Apple from the garage to the world. Much <br>
                                           love to his family during this difficult time. <br>
                                           <p>Alan</p> <br><br>

                                           <h3>Thanks</h3>
                                           Family, Friends and the Apple Team- I'm very impressed and moved on the <br>
                                            impact that's happened on my life and the world around. Unfortunately, it <br>
                                             takes the end of a cycle for the bindings to reveal itself. Please, find a way <br>
                                              for these words to reach someone, be it just one or the world. <br>
                                               Peace and humble gratitude.  <br>

                                               Steve Jobs was truly an incredible and inspiring man, from his exuberant <br>
                                                youth and through his long and courageous struggle. He created the world <br>

                                                   decades - and years to come. We will surely miss him. <br>

                                                   It is a sad day for the Industry since a well-known and highly-respected <br>
